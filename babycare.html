            <h4></h4>
    
            <h3>Product Details</h3>
            <p>Baby Products are products intended to be used on infants and children under the age of three. 
                Baby products are specially formulated to be mild and non-irritating and use ingredients that 
                are selected for these properties. Baby products include baby shampoos, baby Wash and baby lotions, 
                baby oils, baby powders and baby creams. Now a days even baby cologne, baby perfume etc. are also available.</p><br>
        </div> 
        <div class="details">
        <h4>Product info</h4>     
            <p>The effects of baby-care products can usually be divided into the following categories: cleansing, caring, and protection.<br>

            Currently, a multitude of product types can be found in the market. Although the shear number of products is overwhelming, but features are common.</p><br>

        <h4>Cleansing</h4>     
            <p>Bath Additives: As soon as the umbilical cord has fallen off, the baby can be bathed. However, daily bathing of the baby 
                is not advisable, as this would dry out the skin too much. A bath every 2 to 3 days is sufficient. 
                The bath temperature should lie between 36 and 37Â°C.Bath additives usually contain a mixture of 
                various anionic (e.g., fatty alcohol ethersulfates, protein fatty acid condensates), nonionic 
                (e.g., ethoxylated fatty alcohols, fatty acid glycerides), and amphoteric (e.g., betaines) surfactants. 
                Numerous protein hydrolysates, superfatting agents, solubilizing agents, plant extracts, colorants, 
                and perfumes are also found in this product category. In general, bath additives contain mild surfactant 
                mixtures, which neither dry out the skin nor burn in the eyes.</p><br>
            
        <h4>Cleansers for the Diaper Area</h4>     
            <p>Baby oils containing mineral oils as well as oil-impregnated towelettes are widely used.Liquid petrolatum 
                is a very desirable ingredient in view of its stability, touch, barrier function, and cost. Liquid 
                petrolatum also has a remarkable occlusivity.

                Soft towelettes containing mild oil-in-water (o/w) cleansing milks or, alternatively, clear cleansing 
                lotions are also frequently found. They normally contain anionic and/or nonionic surfactants in low 
                concentrations as well as varying amounts of skincare ingredients like plant extracts and protein hydrolysates. 
                These towelettes are also offered in dispenser boxes.
                
                Whereas the irritating effect of soaps mainly results from their alkalinity, the use of alkaline-free 
                soaps has shown that all detergents induce a significant delipidizing effect, which can also contribute 
                to skin irritation.</p><br>

        <h4>Shampoos</h4>     
            <p>Baby shampoos are usually formulated to be nonirritating to the eyes. This guarantees extraordinary product 
                safety and also ensures that babies do not object to shampooing. Although basically the ingredients 
                used are comparable with the ingredients found in bath additives, the concentration of surfactants 
                is normally lower. Viscosity is adjusted to make it hard for the shampoo to migrate into the eyes.</p><br>

        <h4>Care</h4>     
            <p>Face and Body Creams/Body Lotions: Face creams are especially important for the protection against environmental 
                influences like sunlight, wind, and cold temperatures, which may dry out baby skin.<br>

                The composition resembles that of the body-care creams, although the moisturizer content is often higher.</p><br>
