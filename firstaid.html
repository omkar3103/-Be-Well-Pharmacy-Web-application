            <h3>Product Details</h3>
            <p>A first aid kit is a collection of supplies and equipment that is used to give medical treatment. 
                There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and 
                experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area 
                where it may be used, and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area.</p><br>
        </div> 
        <div class="details">
        <h4>First aid info</h4>     
            <p>The international standard for first aid kits is that they should be identified with 
                the ISO graphical symbol for first aid (from ISO 7010) which is an equal white cross on a green background.<br>

                <br>Standard kits often come in durable plastic boxes, fabric pouches or in wall mounted cabinets. 
                The type of container will vary depending on the purpose, and they range in size from wallet-sized through 
                to a large box. It is recommended that all kits are kept in a clean dust and damp proof container to keep
                the contents safe and aseptic.
                
                Kits should be checked regularly and restocked if any items are damaged or are out of date.</p><br>

        <h4>Appearance</h4>     
            <p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) sets a standard for first aid kits of 
                being green, with a white cross, in order to make them easily recognizable to anyone requiring first aid.<br>
                The ISO only endorse the use of the green background and white cross, and this has been adopted as a standard 
                across many countries and regions, including the entire EU. First aid kits are sometimes marked (by an 
                individual or organization) with a red cross on white background, but use of this symbol by anyone but 
                the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or associated agency is illegal under the terms of 
                the First Geneva Convention, which designates the red cross as a protected symbol in all countries signatory 
                to it. One of the few exceptions is in North America, where despite the passing of the First Geneva convention 
                in 1864, and its ratification in the United States in 1881, Johnson & Johnson has used the red cross as a 
                mark on its products since 1887 and registered the symbol as a U.S. trademark for medicinal and surgical plasters in 1905.</p><br>

        <h4>Contents of first aid kits</h4>     
            <p>Commercially available first aid kits available via normal retail routes have traditionally been intended for treatment of 
                minor injuries only. Typical contents include adhesive bandages, regular strength pain medication, gauze and low grade disinfectant.

                Specialized first aid kits are available for various regions, vehicles or activities, which may focus on 
                specific risks or concerns related to the activity. For example, first aid kits sold through marine supply 
                stores for use in watercraft may contain seasickness remedies.</p><br>
