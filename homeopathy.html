            <h3>Product Details</h3>
            <p>Homeopathy, also known as homeopathic medicine, is a medical system that was developed in Germany
                more than 200 years ago. It’s based on two unconventional theories:<br>“Like cures like”<br>“Law of minimum dose”</p><br>
        </div> 
        <div class="details">
        <h4>What Is Homeopathy?</h4>     
        <p>Homeopathy or homoeopathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine. Its practitioners,
        called homeopaths, believe that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in healthy people
        can cure similar symptoms in sick people; this doctrine is called similia similibus curentur, 
        or "like cures like". All relevant scientific knowledge about physics, chemistry, biochemistry
        and biology gained since at least the mid-19th century contradicts homeopathy.
            Homeopathic remedies are typically biochemically inert, and have no effect on any known disease.
            Its theory of disease, centered around principles Hahnemann termed miasms, is inconsistent with
            subsequent identification of viruses and bacteria as causes of disease. Clinical trials have been
            conducted and generally demonstrated no objective effect from homeopathic preparations.
            : The fundamental implausibility of homeopathy as well as a lack of demonstrable effectiveness
            has led to it being characterized within the scientific and medical communities as quackery and fraud.</p><br>

            <p>Homeopathic preparations are termed remedies and are made using homeopathic dilution. In this process,
            the selected substance is repeatedly diluted until the final product is chemically indistinguishable from
            the diluent. Often not even a single molecule of the original substance can be expected to remain in the product.
            Between each dilution homeopaths may hit and/or shake the product, claiming this makes the diluent remember the
            original substance after its removal. Practitioners claim that such preparations, upon oral intake,
            can treat or cure disease.</p>

            <h4>Concept</h4>
            <p>Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by the Scottish physician
            and chemist William Cullen into German. Being sceptical of Cullen's theory that cinchona cured malaria 
            because it was bitter, Hahnemann ingested some bark specifically to investigate what would happen. 
            He experienced fever, shivering and joint pain: symptoms similar to those of malaria itself. From this, 
            Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those 
            of the diseases that they treat.[39] This led to the name "homeopathy", which comes from the Greek: ὅμοιος hómoios, 
            "-like" and πάθος páthos, "suffering".</p><br>

            <h4>Consultation</h4>
            <p>Homeopaths generally begin with a consultation, which can be a 10–15 minute appointment or last for over an hour, 
                where the patient describes their medical history. The patient describes the "modalities", or if their symptoms 
                change depending on the weather and other external factors.[92] The practitioner also solicits information on mood, 
                likes and dislikes, physical, mental and emotional states, life circumstances, and any physical or emotional illnesses.
                This information (also called the "symptom picture") is matched to the "drug picture" in the materia medica or 
                repertory and used to determine the appropriate homeopathic remedies. In classical homeopathy, the practitioner 
                attempts to match a single preparation to the totality of symptoms (the simlilum), while "clinical homeopathy" 
                involves combinations of preparations based on the illness's symptoms.</p><br>
