            <h3>Product Details</h3>
            <p>Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, is an archaic term used to define science-based, modern medicine.
                 There are regional variations in usage of the term. In the United States, the term is used to contrast
                  with osteopathic medicine, especially in the field of medical education. In India,
                   the term is used to distinguish modern medicine from Ayurveda, Homeopathy and other similar
                    alternative/traditional medicine, especially when comparing treatments and drugs.</p><br>

        <!-- <h4>Allopathic medicine</h4> -->
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
              <p>The terms were coined in 1810 by the inventor of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann.
                 It was originally used by 19th-century homeopaths as a derogatory term for heroic medicine,
                the traditional European medicine of the time and a precursor to modern medicine, that did not
                rely on evidence of effectiveness. Heroic medicine was based on the belief that disease is caused
                by imbalance among the four "humours" (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and sought to treat
                disease symptoms by correcting that imbalance, using "harsh and abusive" methods to induce symptoms
                 seen as opposite to those of diseases, rather than treating their underlying causes: disease was
                 caused by an excess of one humour and thus would be treated with its "opposite".</p><br>

                 <p>A study released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001 defined "allopathic medicine"
                    as "the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, biomedicine,
                     evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine." The WHO used the term in a global study in order
                    to differentiate Western medicine from traditional medicine, and from complementary/alternative
                     medicine, noting that in certain areas of the world “the legal standing of practitioners is
                    equivalent to that of allopathic medicine” where practitioners are certified in both 
                    complementary/alternative medicine and Western medicine.</p><br>

                <P>The term allopathy was also used to describe anything that was not homeopathy.
                    Kimball Atwood, an American medical researcher and alternative medicine critic,
                    said the meaning implied by the label of allopathy has never been accepted by
                    conventional medicine and is still considered pejorative by some. American health
                     advocate and skeptic William T. Jarvis, stated that "although many modern therapies
                    can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to
                    relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic
                    principle" and that the label "allopath" was "considered highly derisive by regular
                     medicine." Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines,
                    and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Hahnemann's definition of allopathy,
                     as they seek to prevent illness, or alleviate an illness by eliminating its cause.</P><br>

                    <h4>Etymology</h4> 
                    <p>The terms "allopathic medicine" and "allopathy" are drawn from the Greek prefix ἄλλος,
                     állos, "other," "different" + the suffix πάθος, páthos, "suffering".</p>

                    <h4>Current use</h4>
                    <p>In the United States, the term is used in the modern era to differentiate between
                        two types of US medical schools (both of which teach aspects of science-based medicine
                        and neither of which teach homeopathy): Allopathic (granting the MD degree)
                        and Osteopathic (granting the DO degree).<br>

                        In India the term is used principally to distinguish "Western medicine" from Ayurveda,
                        especially when comparing treatments and drugs.</p>
